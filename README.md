## Deep Learning Projects
1. [Face Mask Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ankur561999/face-mask-detection) - A deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing mask or not. Model is trained using 50 layer ResNet with Keras and achieved 95.95% accuracy on validation set.

   Highlights: *CNN, ResNet50, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, image processing*
   
2. [Malaria Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ankur561999/detecting-malaria-using-inceptionnet) - Created a deep learning model to detect malaria in cell images. Model is trained using InceptionNet with keras and achieved 96% accuracy on validation set.

   Highlights: *InceptionNet (GoogleNet), CNN, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, image processing*
   
3. [Recognizing Cats and Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/ankur561999/recognizing-cats-and-dogs-using-vgg16) - Recognizing images of cats and dogs using vgg16 with 97% accuracy on training set and 93.83% accuracy on validation set.

   Highlights: *VGG16, CNN, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, image processing*
