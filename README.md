# Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository is perceived as a data science portfolio. It contains information about my data science projects that i have completed for self learning.

## Deep Learning Projects
1. [Face Mask Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ankur561999/face-mask-detection) - A deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing mask or not. Model is trained using 50 layer ResNet with Keras and achieved 95.95% accuracy on validation set.

   Highlights: *CNN, ResNet50, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, image processing*
2. [Malaria Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ankur561999/detecting-malaria-using-inceptionnet) - Created a deep learning model to detect malaria in cell images. Model is trained using InceptionNet with keras and achieved 96% accuracy on validation set.

   Highlights: *InceptionNet (GoogleNet), CNN, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, image processing*
